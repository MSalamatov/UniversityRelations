Notes inspired by [Peter Block's 'Flawless consulting'](https://a.co/d/0mwYu4a)

**'A consultant'** is a person who has influence over someone (tech specialist, manager, any other person in a company), but has no direct authority. It makes a consultant different from **a manager**. 

Things managers could do, but consultants couldn't: 

-Hire;
-Fire;
-Promote;
-Submit a Jira task to some of their direct reports;

Thus, the role of a consultant is to inspire people together with proposing the solutions that people truly accept and that they are authentic with. Only in case people deeply accept and support consulant's proposal they procees to real actions. Moreover, it's not correct to think that a consultant has done a poor job in case people in the organization didn't do a thing or implement a thing from consultant's proposal. Again, consultants have no power to make a change and it's not their core function to execute changes proposed. 

In case of **an internal consultant** the person in this role has to take into consideration additional points: 

-You couldn't staisfy only _managers_ needs. There are lots of policies and procedures together with compliances that have to be followed;
-Number of your "cutomers" is restricted by the number of stakeholders in the company;
-Some of the stakeholders won't "buy" your services for years. It's OK; 
-You need to be good with everyone. Again, your number of stakeholders is not so high, in case you've done a poor job with one or two stakeholders the word of mouth could spread widely and unfortunately quickly;
-Some of the doors might be closed for you as your internal grade couldn't be 'approved' to contact some of the more senior grades. External consultants have more flexibility on that. 
-Some line managers could consider you as a competitor (though, it's not true as a conslutant role is different from the one of a manager).
