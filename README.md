# University Relations

## Why do I need this repo?

- Though I truly believe that University Relations is a very important role in any type of a modern company, I haven't seen lots of documents, articles and all that stuff about UR in the internet. Here I'd like to summarize everything I know about this profession;
- Potentially, I'd like to somehow see a global community of UR specialists exchanging their experience. I hope this repository could be a good start;
- Finally, I just want some practice in writing in English.

## Why not a blog?

Honestly, I'm not a good blogger. Moreover, I don't think, blog would be a good way for the staff I'm working on. What I'd like to finally get from this repository is a knowledge base (which is from the best of my knowledge very difficult to be organized in a classic blog format).

To some extent, creation of this repo was inspired by [David Kadavy's 'Digital Zettelkasten'](https://a.co/d/0FnbB60). One of this repo's purposes is to summarize my notes inspired by different books, articles, long reads and other sources.
