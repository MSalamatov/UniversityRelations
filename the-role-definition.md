## Who is a UR manager?

A person who is responsible for connecting business ('the company') with graduate education institutions. Usually, UR managers are responsible for one or many of the following activities: 

- Internships (definition of future interns' roles, skills, selection stages);
- Joint projects (educational, research, etc.);
- Creation and delivery of courses; 
- Students mentoring; 

## What do they usually do? 

Find the best way of collaboration with educational institution that serves current business needs best. That means: 

- Understanding business needs: basically knowing what does the business do, what is a product, what are the skills needed;
- Understanding of universities capabilities and profiles: some of them are good at teaching particular disciplines, some of them have top research teams, some of them are experts in a particular technology, some of them have outstanding technical equipment;
- Setting up a type of collaboration that fits the university profile and responds to business needs;
- Execution tracking of the activities launched; 
- Work with people involved in collaboration with universities: helping them in developing skills (mostly, soft) that are needed for implementing the collaboration in the best possible way; 
- 'Managing up' - presentation of the university program to stakeholders, listening to the feedback, adjusting prgrams accordingly;

Looks like the UR manager role in many cases is more about influencing without athority **there should be a special note about that**. 

## What's a typical profile for the role? 

- Subject matter expertise. In my experience that was basic understanding of SW engineering and computer science. It could come from traditional education (let's say - BSc in SW engineering) or it could be gathered by the way (regular conversations, online learning and all that);
- Soft skills. Oral and written communications, presentations, being nice, polite, patient, understanding and believing; 
- Openness and being ready for expertise sharing. Being ready to become a mentor for both students and your peers; 
- Business acumen. It means in know what are the current business conditions of the company, what are the plans, what is on the radar of the stakeholders. You know how to translate your messages in a way that is aligned with the current business conditions;
