## Intro

Here I'll try to summarize the way I see the internships program being perfectly set up in the company. There are some **important disclaimers** I have to ecplicitly present here before we move to further blocks in this text: 

-This will be the summary of my personal vision of perfect internship program. I've seen numerous examples of internships being implemented in organizations in another way; 
-As almost everywhere I'll use software development area to illustrate different topics of the discussion. I don't know too much about other areas but hope it'll nevertheless be useful;

Finally, significant part of what would be described below has been presented in my [#TeamLeadConf2022](https://youtu.be/rmIr4nIKquA) presentation. Unfortunately, it doesn't have English subptitles. 

## Definitions 

There are number of 'an intern'. Here is the one I prefer more: 

**An intern is a student who gets the skills required to become a full time employee during previously defined term**

Mostly, we hire undergraduate or MSc students as interns. I know there are some exeptions (sometimes we work with recent college graduates), but mostly those are the students who have to somehow combine their work with studies (though, when we talk about summer internships, technically during the summertime students don't have their studies).
