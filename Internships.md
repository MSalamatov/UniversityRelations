## Intro

Here I'll try to summarize the way I see the internships program being perfectly set up in the company. There are some **important disclaimers** I have to ecplicitly present here before we move to further blocks in this text: 

- This will be the summary of my personal vision of perfect internship program. I've seen numerous examples of internships being implemented in organizations in another way; 
- As almost everywhere I'll use software development area to illustrate different topics of the discussion. I don't know too much about other areas but hope it'll nevertheless be useful;

Finally, significant part of what would be described below has been presented in my [#TeamLeadConf2022](https://youtu.be/rmIr4nIKquA) presentation. Unfortunately, it doesn't have English subtitles. 

## Definitions 

There are number of 'an intern'. Here is the one I prefer more: 

**An intern is a student who gets the skills required to become a full time employee during previously defined fixed term**

Mostly, we hire undergraduate or MSc students as interns. I know there are some exeptions (sometimes we work with recent college graduates), but in most cases those are the students who have to somehow combine their work with studies (though, when we talk about summer internships, technically during the summertime students don't have their studies).

Personally, I truly believe that internships have to be fixed-term. My vision is that internships are the final stage of selection process - we double check whether a person is capable of learning. Giving students a fixed time frame to prove their ability to learn looks like a good idea - as in this case the 'selection' process looks even more transparent and connected not only with the skills required to be obtained, but with the timeframe to obtain these skills.

## Creating an internship set up

As we've previously stated an internship definition we could now understand what is needed to set up internships in the company:

- Defined and somehow (sometimes informally) described full-time engineer profile (we know what they do, what they know and what would like to do);
- Knowledge of the market - we know the types of skills that are available among the students community and we know the skills that are almost (somtimes fully) unavailbale.

These two pieces of knowledge in terms could help us set up two important parts of the process: selection and internship timeframe definition.

## Selection of students

Basically students don't know _a lot_ on any topic. And that's fine. Usually their knowledge is pre-defined by 16-32 weeks classes on the subject and self-learning (previously - books, recently - MOOCs). All we could do is to identify the subjects that students have heard somthing about (C++/Java) and subjects that students haven't heard anything about (let's say, Kubernetes or Rust).

So, if we know a portrait of a full-time engineer we know the skills they need to have. And these skills in terms might belong to one of two previously identified areas: students could be familiar with the knowledge areas representing these skills or they could know nothing about these areas. Depending on this we could set up the following strategies of selection.

### We need the skills that students have (on a low level)

### We need the skills that students almost don't have
