## Intro

Here I'll try to summarize the way I see the internships program being perfectly set up in the company. There are some **important disclaimers** I have to ecplicitly present here before we move to further blocks in this text: 

-This will be the summary of my personal vision of perfect internship program. I've seen numerous examples of internships being implemented in organizations in another way; 
-As almost everywhere I'll use software development area to illustrate different topics of the discussion. I don't know too much about other areas but hope it'll nevertheless be useful;

Finally, significant part of what would be described below has been presented in my [#TeamLeadConf2022](https://youtu.be/rmIr4nIKquA) presentation. Unfortunately, it doesn't have English subtitles. 

## Definitions 

There are number of 'an intern'. Here is the one I prefer more: 

**An intern is a student who gets the skills required to become a full time employee during previously defined fixed term**

Mostly, we hire undergraduate or MSc students as interns. I know there are some exeptions (sometimes we work with recent college graduates), but in most cases those are the students who have to somehow combine their work with studies (though, when we talk about summer internships, technically during the summertime students don't have their studies).

Personally, i truly believe that internships have to be fixed-term. My vision is that internships are the final stage of selection process - we double check whether a person is capable of learning. Giving students a fixed time frame to prove their ability to learn looks like a good idea - as in this case the 'selection' process looks even more transparent and connected not only with the skills required to be obtained, but with the timeframe to obtain these skills.
